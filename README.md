# Sprawl game engine
A 2D game engine built to implement __Neon Rain__. 

## Setup
Sprawl requires SDL3 and SDL3_image to run. Instructions for compiling them from source via CMake follow. 

### SDL setup
1. `git clone git@github.com:libsdl-org/SDL.git`
1. `mkdir SDL/build`
1. `cd SDL/build`
1. `cmake path/to/SDL`
1. `make all`
1. `sudo make install`

### SDL_image setup
1. `git clone git@github.com:libsdl-org/SDL_image.git`
1. `mkdir SDL_image/build`
1. `cd SDL_image/build`
1. `cmake path/to/SDL_image`
1. `make all`
1. `sudo make install`

After installing both, you may need to update your shared library cache:
```
sudo ldconfig
```
