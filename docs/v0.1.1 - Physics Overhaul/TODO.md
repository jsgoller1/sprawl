- Break dependencies between components
- Need to work out time and units 
- Collisions and moving should occur up to 1 pixel of accuracy; no floating objects or forcefields
- Elastic collisions should occur between character and enemy
- Mario-style movement upwards during inelastic collisions with wall or floor
- Movement along floor should be exactly the same as movement mid-air; being on the floor should have no bearing on movement
- Objects should fall correctly when gravity is applied to them
